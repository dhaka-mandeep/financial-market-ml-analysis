 Machine Learning Analysis of Financial Market Forecasting

 Overview
This repository presents my Master’s thesis project focused on the **data-driven evaluation of machine learning models**
for forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices.

The study compares traditional and modern machine learning approaches using real-world financial data,
with an emphasis on **model performance, volatility, interpretability, and practical limitations**.


 Research Objectives
- Evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models in financial forecasting
- Compare LSTM, Random Forest, and SVM across stocks and cryptocurrencies
- Analyze the impact of volatility on prediction accuracy
- Identify real-world limitations such as overfitting, data quality, and interpretability
- Assess investor trust through primary survey research


 Datasets Used
**Stocks**
- Apple (AAPL)
- Tesla (TSLA)

Cryptocurrencies**
- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)

Data Sources**
- Yahoo Finance
- CoinMarketCap
- Glassnode
- CryptoQuant

 Features & Analysis
- Time-series price data (2020–2025)
- Technical indicators: RSI, Moving Averages, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- Feature importance analysis
- Volatility comparison between stocks and crypto
- Survey-based trust and adoption analysis

---

 Models Evaluated
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

Key Findings
- LSTM achieved the highest predictive accuracy across both asset classes
- Random Forest provided strong performance with better interpretability
- Cryptocurrency markets exhibited significantly higher volatility, reducing forecast stability
- Technical indicators contributed more to accuracy than macroeconomic variables
- Survey results showed moderate trust in ML predictions, with demand for explainability

---

 Business & Analytical Insights
- ML models can support short-term financial decision-making when properly validated
- Volatility and black-swan events remain major limitations
- Interpretability is critical for real-world adoption in finance
- ML should complement, not replace, human judgment

---

Skills Demonstrated
- Financial data analysis
- Time-series preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation using MSE, MAPE, R²
- Data visualization and reporting
- Quantitative & qualitative research integration
